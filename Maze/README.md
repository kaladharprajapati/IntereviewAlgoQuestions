# Maze solver
Here you can play around with the maze solver I've build. Currently it has 3 algos you can use and it runs on the terminal so you can see how it works.

## To Run
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/obiwankenoobi/IntereviewAlgoQuestions

$ cd path/to/repo

$ npm install

$ cd ./Maze

$ node ./run.js [algo_name] [path_to_maze]
```

* `algo_name = dij || dfs || bfs  `
* `path_to_maze = ./mazes/someMaze.js`
