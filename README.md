# Intereview Algorithm Questions 
## Implemented in Javascript

This repo will have my solutions for a lot of the questions asked by the big companies, together with a [medium](http://www.google.com) article for each of them to explain the process.

  <summary>Find The Largest Multiply - asked by Facebook</summary>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
        Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.
        For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
        You can assume the list has at least three integers.

  <summary>Find The Word In Board - asked by Microsoft</summary>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
    Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word,
    write a function that returns whether the word can be found
    in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.
    For example, given the following matrix:

    [
        ['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
        ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
        ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
        ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']
    ]

and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column.
Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.

  <summary>Two Identical Subsets - asked by Facebook</summary>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
        Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.
        For example, given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}, it would return true, since we can split it up into {15, 5, 10, 15, 10} and {20, 35}, which both add up to 55.
        Given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35}, it would return false, since we can't split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.

  <summary>Perfect Number - asked by Microsoft</summary>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
        A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.
        Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.
        For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.

  <summary>Multiplication Table - asked by Apple</summary>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
        Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is,
        a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).
        Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.
        For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:

        | 1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
        | 2 |  4 |  6 |  8 | 10 | 12 |
        | 3 |  6 |  9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |
        | 4 |  8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |
        | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |
        | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |
